		<section>

<p>An extensive guide on how to discover new music. TBC.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-new-music-appear">How does new music appear?</h2>

<p>As silly as it sounds, some people create music and then decide to share
it to the public.
It can be shared on various supports, digital (a file, mp3, wav, aif, ogg, flac
etc.), analog (tape, vinyl record), or mixed (CD, mixing digital and analog).
The same music can be released on many
supports. These suports have different properties, some make it easy to share
the music. Some put emphasis on the sound quality or the sonic
experience.
In any case what matters is that it gets to an audience enjoying it,
so it is great to combine supports when publishing (as in making public).</p>

<h2 id="a-method-to-discover-new-music-organically-and-learn-your-tastes">A method to discover new music organically, and learn your tastes</h2>

<h3 id="artist">Artist</h3>

<p>You liked something that artist did, she/he/they possibly have other projects you
might enjoy.
Also note that the bassist, trumpetist, backing vocal of an act can
have a solo project, or collaborate with other people. Don&rsquo;t
just look at the big names, dig into those who more in the shadows are also part of the creation of the grooves we like.</p>

<h3 id="label">Label</h3>

<p>Labels are a key on the production of new music, making it happen,
promoting records they create so they are being heard, accessed by
us, the craving audience.</p>

<p>A label is mainly composed of one or a group of persons, puting energy
and time in finding music, artists they like. Then, working together so
an artist music&rsquo;s is compiled and distributed to reach an audience, other people
who might enjoy it. Labels usually publish multiple new music over
their years of activity. You can follow their news, and get music
fresh out from where it&rsquo;s baked.</p>

<p>Many artists are also self pusblishing their records, often you will
be able to follow their updates on the different channels once publish
their work, Youtube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud.</p>

<p>Note that, as for an artist, a label which may have ceased to exist, as in publish new
records, does not make it any less worthy of interest.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, look out for the name of the labels on your
favorite records. Maybe try to find the smallest labels, the ones for
which putting out a record requires as much energy and involvment as
producing its notes. Look it up online, explore its release on Discogs
or at a record in town. This is most definitely where you&rsquo;ll find a
great deal of new favorites.</p>

<h3 id="styles-and-genres">Styles and genres</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ve been listening to rock, house, classic or raggae for a while now. There
is definitely something aside that you will get to love. It maybe even
doesn&rsquo;t have a name yet. Sure the beat is not quite the same, but give
yourself a little time moving some of the rocks surrounding your new
gold. Let pre-constructed opinion asides, there are streams out there that mixes
what you already enjoy and what you will get to love.</p>

<h3 id="save-what-you-find">save what you find</h3>

<p>Buy music to listen at home. Play it on your computer or turntables,
organize it in shelves or in folders, create playlists offline or
online, but store what you find and start building a well organized collection of
good tunes, that you can learn to understand.</p>

<h1 id="some-sources-to-stumble-upon-new-discoveies">Some sources to stumble upon new discoveies</h1>

<p>All the following sources can be combined. Mixing them will lead to great results.</p>

<h2 id="from-the-comfort-of-your-home">From the comfort of your home</h2>

<h3 id="discogs">Discogs</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a> is some sort of community
generated encyclopedia. Everything that can be known about a record
should be found there. If you know something that cannot there be
found, reference it! For the sake of knowledge sharing!  Click the
labels, different artists who made that record possible, listen to all
tracks on an album, look at other users created list in which this
record is. There are many ways you can get serendipity started.</p>

<p>Look as the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/78-Azymuth">Discog&rsquo;s page for the band
Azymuth</a>. You&rsquo;ll find a
list of all their albums, the label they were realeased on, when, who
played the piano etc.</p>

<h3 id="wikipedia">Wikipedia</h3>

<p>The good old Wikipedia, giving you an overview of an artist, a genre, style,
era. Click on those links, get lost, learn and explore, copy paste
name in Youtube, Spotify, listen.</p>

<p>Try out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">Wikipedia page on House music</a>.</p>

<h3 id="youtube">Youtube</h3>

<p>Definitely one of the place where it is the easiest to listen to
music. Start listening to something you know already; then listen to
the side recommandation, other music from the same artists, other
tracks that are suggested that user also listened.
Youtube has developed a crazy algorithm which as been fueled by a
constant and massive ammount of data we give it while browsing the
site. The result is auto-generating lists of somehow related music.</p>

<p>Have you tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te">Musique
concrète</a>?. Here
are two example Youtube videos to start exploring, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq3jItducg">Pierre Schaeffer &amp;
Pierre Henry: Orphée 53
(1953)</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTf0yE15zzI">Pierre
Schaeffer - Études de bruits
(1948)</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, if you enjoy this, or out of curiosity you&rsquo;d like to know
more, look for these names on Discogs, and follow the links!</p>

<h3 id="bandcamp">Bandcamp</h3>

<p>Because <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> is working on offering a
fair cut on sales, this platform is being increasingly used by artists,
labels and other publishing houses to release their work. You can
listen to music that has been uploaded in good quality.</p>

<p>It is always better to know for what you are looking for when going
there as the interface does not lead to exploration accross their
database. For a Wikipedia feeling, where links lead to unexpected
gems, see the section on Discogs.</p>

<p>Great thing being that it is possible to follow favorite artists and
labels, and be notified of their new releases. Bandcamp is one of the
few platform with Discogs on which the label is visible. See the
labels section for why this is a happy fact.</p>

<h3 id="mixcloud">Mixcloud</h3>

<p>A website filled with user submitted mixes. One of the nicest way to
discover music. On <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/">Mixcloud</a> you can
follow djs, labels, music producers, music podcasters playing their
favorite records.</p>

<p>You should definitely look for your favorite artist names on their
site, see who is playing them. That will definitely lead to
discoveries.</p>

<p>One of the great aspect of Mixcloud is that it also shows in most
cases which tune is on air. So when you like something, you can find
it on Bandcamp, Youtube, maybe add it to your Radio4000 channel so you
can listen to it later again.</p>

<h3 id="blogs-and-magazines">Blogs and magazines</h3>

<p>Blogs have been one of the most fantastic creation of Internet. Each
of them islands of knowledge spread accross blog hosting platforms,
Blogger, Wordpress instances.</p>

<p>Many music diggers and amateurs
present and share their discoveries online. They offer a wide range,
sometimes hyper-specialized, of genre explorations to whoever wants to
spend the time to listen.</p>

<p>There are also many magazines about music, talking about releases of new or
old tunes, generalist or specialized. Jazz, raggae, techno, look out
for yours. Find some online, or at the kiosk.</p>

<h3 id="radios">Radios</h3>

<p>Maybe the good old FM radio does not satisfy you any longer? No
worries, there are plenty of web based radios with dedicated people
willing to share the good tunes. <a href="https://blog.radio4000.com/radio-list">This
list</a> could help getting
started.</p>

<h3 id="radio4000">Radio4000</h3>

<p>A good tool to organize and learn from your music
discoveries. <a href="https://radio4000.com">Radio4000</a> is also an amazing
spot to discover what other people on the planet are listening
to. Follow someone else&rsquo;s musical explorations and get inspired by

together to find music at local vinyl shops. Give it a name of a
record you like, see in which record shop it is sold, and explore the
rest of this shop&rsquo;s selection.</p>

<h3 id="parties-concerts-and-festivals">Parties, concerts and festivals</h3>

<p>Same here. A party, concerts or festivals mostly start to exist because
some people wanted to share good music and good acts they discovered. There is high chance
those person are also willing to create for you a unique moment in
time and space you won&rsquo;t forget.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is forever work in progress. It is solely an introduction to what
is a possible way to dig new music, suggesting ways some might not yet know.</p>

<p>In any case, share your discoveries online and offline. Listen to more music, at
your workplace or at home, on headphones or speakers, go enjoy acts at
venues.  Start creating your music, alone or together, with your name
