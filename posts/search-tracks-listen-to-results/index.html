		<section>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Today a new feature appears on the site, <strong>tracks search</strong>.</p>

<p>On top of now being able to search any radio tracks, and find the one
you want to play, you can from today <strong>listen to a selection of tracks
from a radio</strong>.</p>

Tobha</a></em><br />
That&rsquo;s right, you can try it now, <a href="https://radio4000.com/search">go to any radio (of course, yours
too!), and explore the list of tracks. Just search for something, and if
there are any results press the &ldquo;load selection&rdquo; button to listen to
everything in the player.<br />
</a></p>

<h2 id="about-hashtags">About #hashtagsÂ </h2>

<p>Hashtags are pretty neat, they can be used to create &ldquo;playlists&rdquo; from
your tracks.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say, that if on every &ldquo;jazz&rdquo; track in you radio, you add to the
description the term &ldquo;#jazz&rdquo;; you and every other user will then be
able to search for all tracks that you decided to tag. Therefore,
<strong>hashtags can be used as tags</strong>, if you feel like it.</p>

<h2 id="track-description-and-title">Track description, and title</h2>

<p>Every track you add to you radio can have a &ldquo;title&rdquo; and &ldquo;description&rdquo;.
These two fields are used to lookup for your search. You can add every
information you think is usefull to a description.</p>

<p>Fig 2. <a href="https://radio4000.com/radio-girafe/tracks?search=1978">Radio
Girafe</a> use of
track descriptions allows to play a selection of tracks from &ldquo;1978&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>We this is a major feature and a pretty usefull one. It is also only the
beginning as some new ideas will soon come to complement this feature.</p>

<p>If you start using #hashtags in your tracks, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;#cumbia&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;#party&rdquo;, you can also &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; your tags in your radio channel
description. That way, listeners looking for a radio with &ldquo;cumbia&rdquo; will
be able to find you, and listen directly to your cumbia selection; a
good match.</p>

<p>Last teaser, wouldn&rsquo;t it be sweet if your tracks could easily have tags
already? Let&rsquo;s say, the country of origin, the track released year, the
record label that published it&hellip; genre? styles? Many possibilities in
this forseable future.</p>

<p>As usual, let us know if you&rsquo;re having any feedback, issue or want to
get in touch:</p>

<p>Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy the digging.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
