TEN years later and somehow Radio4000 is still online.

But we are not able to repair or improve the project in its current state. It's more frustration than joy. We need a new structure for the next ten years: enter _Web Components_ and _SQL_.

If you open https://radio4000.com today, for the first time in a loooong time, it is new. 

Instead of going through all the changes now, let's focus on accounts and your data. 

## Don't have your own radio yet?

Well, enjoy the new Radio4000.

## Do you have a radio?

- You must create a new account
- You can migrate your existing radio to the new system

We naturally tried to make this as easy as possible. Please reach out if you need help! We are always available on the chat.
