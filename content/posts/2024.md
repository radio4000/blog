TEN years later and Radio4000 is still online.

This is quite something and tonight we will celebrate. As of now _April 2024_,
if you open https://radio4000.com today, for the first time in a loooong time, it is new. 

We've archived the old site on https://v1.radio4000.com and put it in read/listen-only mode.

To continue operating your radio, first create a new account, then migrate your channel on https://migrate.radio4000.com. If we could have done this for you, we would have.

Please reach out if you need help! We are always available on the chat.

## But why, everything was fine?

Well, no. We have not been able to work on v1 for years. Essentially no new features has happened since 2017. The project doesn't even turn on any longer on our computers, talk about technical debt. Being slightly hurt from this experience, we've looked at alternatives for the next decade.

We've literally build R4 twenty times behind the scenes. With Ember, Svelte, React, Vue, Astro, Custom Element.. you name it, we tried it. In the end we've settled on _SQL_ and _Web Components_. 

- Check the [components code](https://github.com/radio4000/components) or view it in action on [R4](https://radio4000.com).

Experiments are already happening with decentralization, federation, the matrix protocol and a local-first architecture.

Instead of going through all the changes now like I would have expected myself to do,
take the time to migrate your radio! Add some new tracks or just listen to all the tunes.

Let's be more like this cow.
