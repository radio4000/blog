		In an effort to free the project from dependencies, the creation of a new user (therefore a radio), will no longer be possible, using any external social providers. Also, in a close future we will enforce login with email/password for every users that are currently using social providers.
 Currently Facebook and Goole have been provided as a matter of convenience for user who might not wish to create for themeselves an account using an email/password pair.

		What&rsquo;s happened to Radio4000 in the year 2018? Let&rsquo;s see.
You can search the tracks in a radio and listen to just that selection.
More on https://blog.radio4000.com/posts/search-tracks-listen-to-results
 Example: https://radio4000.com/lili-raid-over/tracks?search=%23beat.
 You can connect a Discogs release to your youtube tracks. When you do it, we try to add both genre, label and year to the description of the track. This works nicely with the seach feature. Speaking of Discogs, we also made an alpha version of a &ldquo;Explorer for Discogs&rdquo;.

Before this update, settings were split between /auth/settings and /{channel-slug}/edit. Now, both will redirect to /settings.

One long time issue was using Radio4000 on mobile devices, because until now it was not possible to play a Radio4000 radio and lock the device&rsquo;s screen.
This is now solved!
How to play Radio4000 with the mobile phone screen locked The solution is pretty simple, but will work only for Android and on Firefox.

	<p>
		An extensive guide on how to discover new music. TBC.
How does new music appear? As silly as it sounds, some people create music and then decide to share it to the public. It can be shared on various supports, digital (a file, mp3, wav, aif, ogg, flac etc.), analog (tape, vinyl record), or mixed (CD, mixing digital and analog). The same music can be released on many supports. These suports have different properties, some make it easy to share the music.

		While using Radio4000 each user are building a library of sounds. All the tunes added in your radio, its name, description, compose the data associated with your account on the application.
You own this data, all content you add on Radio4000.
Therefore you should have the possibility to always have this data stored where you would like. Radio4000 is simply a space online where you can store and edit it.

Today a new feature appears on the site, tracks search.
On top of now being able to search any radio tracks, and find the one you want to play, you can from today listen to a selection of tracks from a radio.

That&rsquo;s right, you can try it now, go to any radio (of course, yours too!), and explore the list of tracks.

		There is a new way to discover Radio4000 channels online, a map of the world.
As of today everyone can position their Radio4000 channel to one location in the world. So can you!
There are no restriction, nor any obligation. As always freedom first. You only decide if and where you would like your channel to appear on the map; where your body resides or your heart belongs, it is and will remain your choice.

You can customize the values in pixels of `width` and `height` of this `iframe` HTML element to suit your design needs. If you look closer, you will see the part in the `src` property, ending with `?

		Hello there,
just wanted to share with you two good tips to start listening to a radio as fast as possible.
Let&rsquo;s take a radio, could be yours, could be anyone else&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s say balls, radio4000.com/balls, hi balls!
When you want to play this radio on radio4000.com, you will probably type the address of radio4000 in your web browser, then visit the radio page before finally hitting the play button or a track on the chosen radio.

		Yes, Radio4000 now officially has an API!
api: https://api.radio4000.com
documentation &amp; code: https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000-api
This means you can now use the public data from Radio4000.com (such as the radio channels and their tracks) to create any softwares, hardwares, websites or applications.
What is an API?
An API (application programming interface) can take many aspects and is a term generally used in software development. In the current case we could summarize it as a set of tools and specifications defined (here by the Radio4000 team) to help developers apprehend and use data made available through the API.

		Good evening!
Tonight Radio4000 gets updated to a new major version (github#v.5.0.0). We&rsquo;re happy to introduce some new features, and an effort to harmonize the overall experience across the software.
It is coming in with a new radio channel homepage and a new design now including the latest 10 tracks. A new subpage therefore appears under your radio, /tracks. This choice aims to help improve loading performances, and usability such as easing the experience of adding a new track to one&rsquo;s radio.

If you&rsquo;re not already using the bookmarklet, you should try it out. After you&rsquo;ve saved the bookmarklet it&rsquo;s only two-taps to add a track while you&rsquo;re browsing YouTube.

		Radio4000 updates to version 3.3! What’s new?In order to explore radios faster, we’ve added a “play ‘n shuffle” button on the radio channel cards. Try it, tap it as many times as you like, we think it makes listening much more fun. Your favorite radios are taking the place of the “most popular radios” section directly on the homepage.We’ve also started implementing a new design for radios, further innovations can be expected in the upcoming versions.

We also streamlined the header and player design while preparing for the Ember 2.0 update which should make everything leaner.
Oh, and we added a cheesy loading screen in fifty shades of languages.
