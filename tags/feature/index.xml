      <description>While using Radio4000 each user are building a library of sounds. All the tunes added in your radio, its name, description, compose the data associated with your account on the application.
You own this data, all content you add on Radio4000.
Therefore you should have the possibility to always have this data stored where you would like. Radio4000 is simply a space online where you can store and edit it.</description>
