		There is a new way to discover Radio4000 channels online, a map of the world.
As of today everyone can position their Radio4000 channel to one location in the world. So can you!
There are no restriction, nor any obligation. As always freedom first. You only decide if and where you would like your channel to appear on the map; where your body resides or your heart belongs, it is and will remain your choice.

		Yes, Radio4000 now officially has an API!
api: https://api.radio4000.com
documentation &amp; code: https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000-api
This means you can now use the public data from Radio4000.com (such as the radio channels and their tracks) to create any softwares, hardwares, websites or applications.
What is an API?
An API (application programming interface) can take many aspects and is a term generally used in software development. In the current case we could summarize it as a set of tools and specifications defined (here by the Radio4000 team) to help developers apprehend and use data made available through the API.
